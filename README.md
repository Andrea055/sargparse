# SArgparse

SArgparse is a sane argument parsing library for Rust. It has the same API as python's argparse library which makes it quite relatable for people coming from a python environment.

## Why did I create this?

I know there are similar libraries that do the same thing, but I felt that their API was contorted and truly ugly, I wanted to make sure that people don't have to spend too much time figuring out how to use a basic arugment parser and so I took python's API and copied it in this library.
